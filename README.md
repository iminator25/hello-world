Finally filling out the hub. 

Here I will be publishing different projects that I have created some that are inspired by school assignments and
others that I have dreamt up on my own.

A little bit about me. I am computer science and physics student at The University of British Columbia in
Vancouver,  BC. I enjoy writing programs based on physics and math in C++ and making mini games in Java. 
I am starting to gain an interest in cyber security and the way it works to keep our information safe. 
I am looking forward to learning more about that subject and publishing some projects on the topic. 

Thanks for reading this.
